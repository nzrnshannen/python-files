Hello! ^_^

The programs that I've created were based on Joyce Farrell's book (PROGRAMMING: Logic and Design Introductory)
which consists of flowcharts and pseudocode (it follows a procedural approach). In which, in my perspective,
perfect for conducting python programs (starting from the basics).

This repository serves as a practice for me. :)
